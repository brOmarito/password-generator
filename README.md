# password-generator
This project was mainly to practice my javascript by creating an application that would generate a password based off of some user input. The user will decide how long the password is and what type of characters the password should contain. The generator will confirm that the password contains at least one of each character type selected. Once verified, the application will update the box on the webpage with the generated password.

To get more specific, it takes user input and based off of what is provided, it creates an array with the possible characters and randomly selects characters from that array.

## Improvements
* Remove the prompts and add some form fields on the website in order to make the UX better
